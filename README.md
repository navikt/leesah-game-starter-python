## Setup 📝

To get started, either clone with git or download the repository:

**git clone**
```
git clone https://github.com/navikt/leesah-game-starter.git
```

**Download repository**
```
Click 'Code' on top of this page
Click 'Download ZIP' and download the the repository into the folder you want to store the files in
Unpack ZIP 
```

### 1.Setup virtual environment for the project

We recommend to use a virtual environment to install the dependencies. Set one up using

**For macOS/Linux**
```bash
cd leesah-game-starter
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

**For Windows**
```bash
cd leesah-game-starter
python3 -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

or see guide [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)

### 2. Install dependencies 

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download Kafka certificates
- In your browser, navigate to link provided by the course hosts.
  - Enter username and password provided by the course crew
- unzip downloaded file
- Place the containing files (`ca.pem`, `leesah_cerds.json`) in `certs/` under the project directory

The result should look like this:
```bash
leesah-game-starter
├── certs
│   ├── .gitignore
│   ├── ca.pem
│   ├── leesah_creds.json
```


### 4. Change the application config

- set `TEAM_NAME` to your preferred team name 😼
- set `QUIZ_TOPIC` to the topic name provided by the course administrators

```python
# Config ##########

TEAM_NAME = "CHANGE ME"
QUIZ_TOPIC = "quiz-rapid"
CONSUMER_GROUP_ID = f"cg-leesah-team-${TEAM_NAME}-1"
```

### 4. Run the application

Run the application from the terminal using:

```bash
python3 leesah-game-client
```
*The project comes with a \_\_main\_\_.py file that makes the directory runnable*

## Developing your quiz participant 🤖

Your challenge is to implement a QuizParticipant that answers all the question messages that are
published by the quizmaster 🧙. You are free to develop your application as you want but this starter project comes with 
som useful boilerplate so you can focus on the fun part, answering questions! 🎉

The code you need to extend is all located in `./lessah-game-client/main.py` when you run `python3 leesah-game-client` 
the `main()` function in `./lessah-game-client/main.py` is executed.


### Configuration
**Remember to change the team name!** We will explain `CONSUMER_GROUP_ID` during the quiz, but if you are curious see [here for a in-depth explanation](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/consumer.html#consumer-groups) 

```python
# Config ##########

TEAM_NAME = "CHANGE ME"
QUIZ_TOPIC = "quiz-rapid"
CONSUMER_GROUP_ID = f"cg-leesah-team-${TEAM_NAME}-1"

# #################
```

### Main loop
The main loop creates a `QuizRapid` object that runs your `QuizParticipant`. 

```python
def main():
    rapid = quiz_rapid.QuizRapid(TEAM_NAME, QUIZ_TOPIC, HOSTED_KAFKA, CONSUMER_GROUP_ID, False)

    try:
        while True:
            rapid.run(MyParticipant())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nstopping...")

```

### QuizParticipant
Again you are free to program the application as you like but the `QuizParticipant` is a handy abstract class you
can extend to get started solving the questions.

**Extending the QuizParticipant**
There are two methods you need to implement in your own class. 

- `handle_question(self, question: quiz_rapid.Question)` Is the most important method, it is where you will receive questions to answer.
- `handle_assessment(self, assessment: Assessment):` Allows you to read assessments the quizmaster make of your answers


## Tips and Tricks 💡

**1. Dont be afraid to answer several times to the same question** *(Except for questions that requires you don't)*

**2. Filter out question categories and write handler functions**

**3. Ask us! We don't bite :)**
